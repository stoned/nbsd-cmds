# (Net)BSD commands

Because one needs `apply` or `jot` this repository provides a quick and
adhoc way to have these NetBSD commands installed in /usr/local on a
Fedora system (or a similar system, as left as an exercice to the reader).

Compilation and installation:

    $ make
    $ sudo make install
